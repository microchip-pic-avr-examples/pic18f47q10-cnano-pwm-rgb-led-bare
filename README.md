# PIC18F47Q10 PWM RGB-LED Using Interrupts

## Objective:
This repository contains an example of bare-metal code for PWM as described in [*TB3270 - Getting Started with PWM Using CCP on PIC18*](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/Getting-Started-with-PWM-Using-CCP-on-PIC18-DS90003270A.pdf) document from Microchip.
<br>The PIC18F47Q10 features four 10-bit PWM generators. In this demo, the CCP1, CCP2 and PWM3 peripherals in conjunction with TMR2 are used to produce PWM signals featuring a color game on an RGB LED.
Three GPIO pins are used as outputs: RB0, RB3 and RD0.

## Hardware Used
- PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano [(DM182029)](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM182029)
- one RGB LED either common anode (default) or common cathode, resistors, wires and optionally a breadboard

## Setup
The PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano Development Board is used as the test platform.

The following configuration is done for this example:
- RB0 pin - Configured as digital PWM output (PWM1)
- RB3 pin - Configured as digital PWM output (PWM2)
- RD0 pin - Configured as digital PWM output (PWM3)


## Operation

Assemble the circuit, then  build and run the code.
The PWM frequency is fixed 7.8kHz on all three outputs while the PWM's duty-cycles are varied from minimum to the maximum during interrupt routine, like in the presented picture:

## Summary
This project showcases how to configure the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller for generating three PWM signals and duty-cycle update during interrupt.
